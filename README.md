# ALX - 0x11. C - printf

**Collaborators:** Tony Lewis MANZI, DUKUNDABERA Anastase

## Overview

Welcome to our "C - printf" project, completed as part of the ALX program curriculum. This project's primary objective is to implement a simplified version of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The `printf` function is a powerful tool for formatting and printing data in various ways.

## Description

Our `printf` project is designed to replicate the core functionality of the standard C library `printf` function. It supports a selection of format specifiers for character and string printing and handles various data types. Although it may not cover all the features and edge cases of the standard `printf`, it serves as an educational exercise to understand and implement this fundamental function.

## Requirements

- This project is primarily written in C, so a C compiler is needed to build the code.
- Any additional project-specific requirements or dependencies can be found in the project's specific documentation.

## Usage

To compile and use the `printf` function in your C programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the source files to create a library or executable, depending on the project's structure.

4. Include the appropriate header file in your C code:

Note: While cloning remember to use the github user name of the one who created the repo.
